<br>
Using Python CV2 , simple computer vision scripts have been written.
<ul>
  <li><b>read_write.py</b> shows how to load and display images</li>
  <li><b>CamCap.py</b> uses your webcam as the input and detects faces </li>
  <li><b>detection.py</b> is a script which is able to detect different colors in the image. Script has an interactive mask which can be adjusted to filter out different colors</li>
  <li><b>contours.py</b> is script to understand what is contours</li>
  <li><b>Virtual_mouse.py</b> is a program which uses object detection to control mouse cursor.</li>
